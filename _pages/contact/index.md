## Open Positions
**Undergraduate Research Asssistant**

This semester, Prof. Mina Choi and her research team will be conducting research on communication technology (VR, Social Media, etc.). We need a few undergraduate research assistants to help conduct these studies.

The undergrad RA's will receive 1-course credit in EMAT 49996 â€“ Individual Investigation in EMAT and will receive a letter grade at the end of the semester. Per university regulations, research assistants are required to put in 3 hrs of work per week for every course credit.
The RAs will be responsible for running the studies, conducting library research, and providing administrative support. No prior research experience is necessary. We will work very closely with the RAs and provide as much direction and guidance as necessary. This is a great opportunity to learn hands-on about how research is conducted and is particularly recommended to those of you who are interested in graduate studies or pursuing corporate research.
If you have a successful semester as a research assistant, you will be invited to repeat EMAT 49996 as many times as you like. If available, we may invite you to be a paid research assistant during winter break.

If you are interested in this opportunity, please email Matthew Craig (mcraig27@kent) with copies of your resume, an unofficial copy of your transcript, and your schedule for this semester. The schedule should include classes, extracurricular activities, and employment so that your availability is clear. If your experience and availability fit our needs this semester, one of the lab members will contact you to set up an interview. Spots will be filled as soon as possible, so please do not hesitate to send him materials. To guarantee application review, please submit these materials by the end of the day Thursday, September 15th.
